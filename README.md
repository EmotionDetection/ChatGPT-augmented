Abstract 
In addressing the scarcity of diverse and quality data for emotion detection beyond English, our study introduces an innovative text augmentation approach utilizing ChatGPT, aimed at enriching Korean emotion recognition models. By creating fictional narratives that simulate a wide range of emotional expressions, we expanded our dataset twentyfold, including Ekman's six basic emotions and an extended set of 24 emotions. This approach increased the dataset from 19,617 original words to 400,166 ChatGPT-generated sentences, significantly boosting model accuracy from 41% to 73%. Additionally, to ensure a balanced representation, we produced 480,000 additional sentences across 24 emotional categories, improving model performance to 75%. Acknowledging the constraints of purely fictional data, we supplemented our dataset with 63,516 translated from English sentences that genuinely express Ekman's six emotions, leading to a notable accuracy increase to 79% across both test sets. This strategy demonstrates the utility of narratives generated by large language models for expanding datasets and offers a method for equilibrating emotion detection models across both fictional and non-fictional narratives.
